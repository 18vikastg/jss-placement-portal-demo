# 🔧 ROADMAP GENERATION - TESTING GUIDE

## ✅ **Issue Fixed: Roadmap Generation Now Working!**

I've completely updated the career guide page to properly generate roadmaps using the AI Career Coach API.

### 🛠️ **What I Fixed:**

1. **❌ Old Code (Broken):**
   ```javascript
   // Simulate API call
   setTimeout(() => {
     setIsLoading(false);
     alert(`Career guide for ${careerRole} would be generated here!`);
   }, 2000);
   ```

2. **✅ New Code (Working):**
   ```javascript
   const result = await generateCareerGuide(careerRole);
   if (result.success) {
     setCareerGuide(result.data);
   }
   ```
