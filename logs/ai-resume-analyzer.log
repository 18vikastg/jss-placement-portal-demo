/home/vikas/jupyter-env/lib/python3.12/site-packages/spacy/util.py:930: UserWarning: [W094] Model 'en_training' (0.0.0) specifies an under-constrained spaCy version requirement: >=2.1.4. This can lead to compatibility problems with older versions, or as new spaCy versions are released, because the model may say it's compatible when it's not. Consider changing the "spacy_version" in your meta.json to a version range, with a lower and upper pin. For example: >=3.8.7,<3.9.0
