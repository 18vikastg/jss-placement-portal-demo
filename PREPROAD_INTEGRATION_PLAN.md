# ðŸš€ PrepRoad AI Career Coach Integration Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Integration Strategy

We're merging the **PrepRoad AI Career Coach** (Next.js app) into the **JSS Placement Portal** (React/Node.js app) to create a comprehensive placement and career coaching platform.

## ðŸ“‹ Integration Approach

### 1. **Folder Structure Integration**
```
jss-placement-portal/
â”œâ”€â”€ placement-portal/           # Existing JSS Portal

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ backend/               # Node.js API
