# 🔧 ROADMAP GENERATION ERROR - DEBUGGING GUIDE

## ✅ **Fixes Applied:**

1. **Added Input Validation** - Check for valid career role input
2. **Enhanced Error Handling** - Better logging and error messages  
3. **API Key Fallback** - Use fallback data if Gemini API is unavailable
4. **Comprehensive Fallback Data** - Rich career guide even when API fails
5. **Fixed Response Structure** - Proper success/error format
6. **Removed Duplicate Files** - Fixed Next.js warnings

## 🧪 **Testing Steps:**

### 1. **Verify Service is Running:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/career-guide
# Should return HTML (not error)
```

### 2. **Test with Browser:**
- Go to: http://localhost:3001/career-guide
- Enter: "Software Developer" 
- Click "Generate Guide"
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

### 3. **Check Logs:**
Watch the terminal where AI Career Coach is running for error messages.

## 🔍 **Common Issues & Solutions:**

### **Issue 1: API Key Invalid**
- **Symptom**: "Failed to generate career guide"
- **Solution**: Should automatically use fallback data
- **Check**: Look for "using fallback data" in logs

### **Issue 2: Network/Connection Error**
- **Symptom**: Loading but no response
- **Solution**: Check if port 3001 is accessible
- **Test**: `curl http://localhost:3001`

### **Issue 3: Invalid Input**
- **Symptom**: Error before generation starts
- **Solution**: Enter a valid career role (e.g., "Software Engineer")

### **Issue 4: Browser Cache**
- **Symptom**: Old behavior persists
- **Solution**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) or clear cache

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior:**

1. **Enter Career Role**: "Full Stack Developer"
2. **Click Generate**: Shows loading spinner
3. **Result**: Detailed roadmap with:
   - Career overview
   - Salary information  
   - Learning phases (4 phases)
   - Skills, tools, projects for each phase
   - Resume guidance

## 📋 **Debug Commands:**

```bash
# Check if service is running
ps aux | grep "npm run dev"

# Check port 3001
curl http://localhost:3001

# View service logs
# (Check terminal where npm run dev is running)

# Test specific endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/career-guide -d '{"careerRole":"Software Engineer"}'
```

## 🚀 **If Still Having Issues:**

The system now has comprehensive fallback data, so even if the AI API fails, you should get a detailed career roadmap. If you're still seeing "Failed to generate career guide", please:

1. Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
2. Look at the terminal logs where AI Career Coach is running
3. Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) of the browser page

The roadmap generation should now work reliably with rich fallback data! 🎉
